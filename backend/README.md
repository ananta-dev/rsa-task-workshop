## Mock API

IMPORTANT: The json-server port has been changed to 4000 to leave port 3000 free for create-react-app.

Please install the npm dependencies `npm install` and start project `npm start`, this in turn will generate the mocked data and host the API on port 4000.

To get the details of the quote please use the following endpoint:
